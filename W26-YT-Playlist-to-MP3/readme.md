Python

Takes a playlist from youtube to converts the entire thing into mp3s

yt-dlp library
React frontend

Ideas to expand on:
- Allow single video downloads
- Make UI prettier (allow you to press download instead of auto starting)
- Make a proper logo
- Return information on the playlist you're downloading to the frontend
- Deploy it somewhere
- Rate liimt the backend so i dont get fined like 50000000 dollars of computation costs
