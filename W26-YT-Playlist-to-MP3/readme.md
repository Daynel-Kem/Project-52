# Python

## Summary
Takes a playlist from youtube url and returns a zip containing all the songs converted into mp3s of the playlist

### Technologies Used:
- React
- Flask
- yt-dlp

### Ideas to expand on:
- Allow single video downloads
- Make UI prettier (allow you to press download instead of auto starting)
- Make a proper logo
- Return information on the playlist you're downloading to the frontend
- Basically means make a new backend api that just returns youtube info
- Deploy it somewhere
- Rate liimt the backend so i dont get fined like 50000000 dollars of computation costs
