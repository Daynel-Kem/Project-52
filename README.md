# Project 52
 My Year Long Campaign of making a side project every week

 Here's a list of the projects:
 1. W1 - [Matrix Calculator](W1-Matrix-Calculator)
 1. W2 - [Portfolio Updated](W2-Portfolio-Updated)
 1. W3 - [Chatbot Lvl1](W3-Chatbot-Lvl1)

## Week 1 - Matrix Calculator
A Matrix class implemented in C++ that allows you to perform basic Matrix Arithmetic and a few Linear Algebra Operations.
As it currently stands, a few implementations of member functions are being handled with the C++ Eigen library. Eventually I will replace these implementations
with my own.
This is an initial 1.0.0 release as there is much to be added including, but not limited to:
- GUI
- Main Program
- Proper Exception Handling
- Step-by-step solutions
- Complex + Rational Solutions (currently using doubles)

However, this release does include the basic necessities needed for the calculator:
- Vectors
- Matrix Addition
- Scalar Multiplication
- Matrix Multiplication
- Tranpose
- Determinant
- Row Reduced Echelon Form (RREF)
- Inverse
- Solve Ax = b
- Eigenvalues & Eigenvectors

I will definitely work more on this project (as it is also quite useful for me for school work), but here is my week 1 product.

## Week 2 - Portfolio Updated
A simple update to my Portfolio Website (Will soon be on [danielyh.kim](https://danielyh.kim), currently using my old portfolio website)
The stack that I'm using to create this portfolio is Next.js with React.js
I followed a tutorial to create the basic template of the website, however, this will definitely be heavily modified because the website doesn't look
the way I would like it to look.

## Week 3 - Chatbot Lvl1
A pretty small and simple AI Chatbot that uses OpenAI's api with Python to create a chatbot that types in a similar fashion to myself. 
Whilst it doesn't exactly type the way I type, it does use similar slang and messaging styles that I use when I message other people.
It's not a very big project but it was fun and we need to take first steps whenever starting something, right?
