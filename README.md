# Project 52
 My Year Long Campaign of making a side project every week

 Here's a list of the projects:
 W1 - Matrix Calculator
 "link to the github repo"

## Week 1 - Matrix Calculator
A Matrix class implemented in C++ that allows you to perform basic Matrix Arithmetic and a few Linear Algebra Operations
As it currently stands, a few implementations of member functions are being handled with the C++ Eigen library. Eventually I will replace these implementations
with my own.
This is an initial 1.0.0 release as there is much to be added including, but not limited to:
- GUI
- Main Program
- Proper Exception Handling
- Step-by-step solutions
- Complex + Rational Solutions (currently using doubles)
However, this release does include the basic necessities needed for the calculator:
- Matrix Addition
- Scalar Multiplication
- Matrix Multiplication
- Tranpose
- Determinant
- Row Reduced Echelon Form (RREF)
- Inverse
- Solve Ax = b
- Eigenvalues & Eigenvectors

I will definitely work more on this project (as it is also quite useful for me for school work), but here it is as it stands.
